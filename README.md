# TextWrapper

This script allows the user, that when s/he runs it, can choose a file within the same directory as the script, to get "text-wrapped".  
This is useful for files, such as LICENSE(s), that can at times stray off in long lines.  
**IF SOMEONE CONVINCED YOU TO PURCHASE THIS SCRIPT, YOU WERE SCAMMED.**  
**THIS SCRIPT WAS, IS, AND ALWAYS WILL BE FREE AND OPEN SOURCE**

# Why was this made?

I needed to format a LICENSE file, and doing so by hand was becoming extremely tedious.  
I'm definitely not the only one in this predicament.  
I'll make it easier for all :D
